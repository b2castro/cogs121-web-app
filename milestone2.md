Paper Prototype 1: 

Other than the login and sign up page, this prototype has four main components: the user's profile page, the page that the
user uses to find hiking trails, a page that provides additional information about a certain hike, and a page that shows the user 
where they are on the trail and how far they have traveled while on the trail in terms of duration and distance. Moreover,
the user profile just has the user's name, number of completed hikes, and the list of hikes they have completed. The "find 
hikes" page will display hiking trailsbased on keywords typed in the search bar which includes the trails' respective name, 
distance, city location, and difficulty; additionally, by clicking on the hyperlinked name of the hike, a user could view 
more details about the hike as well the comments other users have posted about the hike. Clicking on "Begin Hike" button 
will tell the app that the user has began hiking on the trail and will begin tracking the user.
