Story Board 1: 

This storyboard explains some of the many ways our hiking application can be used. Our applications is meant for those who want to explore nature and go on great hikes. This application allows the user to not only see what markers are along the hike that other users have added so hikers can compare trails. Not only will they be able to compare trails but they would also be able to see how far certain markers are so they donâ€™t have to do the whole trail they can visit a certain marker and come back. Along the hike the application also allows users to add markers of their own that other users can then like and comment on. Additionally, users can time how long it took them to complete the hike and compare it with other users.

Paper Prototype 1: 

Other than the login and sign up page, this prototype has four main components: the user's profile page, the page that the
user uses to find hiking trails, a page that provides additional information about a certain hike, and a page that shows the user 
where they are on the trail and how far they have traveled while on the trail in terms of duration and distance. Moreover,
the user profile just has the user's name, number of completed hikes, and the list of hikes they have completed. The "find 
hikes" page will display hiking trailsbased on keywords typed in the search bar which includes the trails' respective name, 
distance, city location, and difficulty; additionally, by clicking on the hyperlinked name of the hike, a user could view 
more details about the hike as well the comments other users have posted about the hike. Clicking on "Begin Hike" button 
will tell the app that the user has began hiking on the trail and will begin tracking the user.
