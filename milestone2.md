Story Board 1: 

This storyboard explains some of the many ways our hiking application can be used. Our applications is meant for those who want to explore nature and go on great hikes. This application allows the user to not only see what markers are along the hike that other users have added so hikers can compare trails. Not only will they be able to compare trails but they would also be able to see how far certain markers are so they donâ€™t have to do the whole trail they can visit a certain marker and come back. Along the hike the application also allows users to add markers of their own that other users can then like and comment on. Additionally, users can time how long it took them to complete the hike and compare it with other users.

Storyboard 2:

In part 1 of the storyboard, the user can see their hiking history, which includes what trails they have completed and what distance. This allows them to estimate their trail stamina. In part 2 of the storyboard, the user can see what trails they can attempt in the future, showing both the trail and the difficulty level of said trail (measured in length and elevation). In part 3 of the storyboard, the user can see their completion time for each trail as well which attempt it was so they can compare to their past performance. In part 4 of the storyboard, the user can see where they are while on the trail. In part 5 of the storyboard, the user can see the opinions of other users on certain trails to see if it is one they are interested in. In part 6 of the storyboard, the user can see who is the best hiker for certain trails based on completion time.

Paper Prototype 1: 

Other than the login and sign up page, this prototype has four main components: the user's profile page, the page that the
user uses to find hiking trails, a page that provides additional information about a certain hike, and a page that shows the user 
where they are on the trail and how far they have traveled while on the trail in terms of duration and distance. Moreover,
the user profile just has the user's name, number of completed hikes, and the list of hikes they have completed. The "find 
hikes" page will display hiking trailsbased on keywords typed in the search bar which includes the trails' respective name, 
distance, city location, and difficulty; additionally, by clicking on the hyperlinked name of the hike, a user could view 
more details about the hike as well the comments other users have posted about the hike. Clicking on "Begin Hike" button 
will tell the app that the user has began hiking on the trail and will begin tracking the user.

Paper Prototype 2:

The login and the signup page are both connected. Once the user logs in or signs up and then logs in, the user will be redirected to the main page, the "My hikes" page. My Hikes is a page that loads up a list of all the hikes a user has been on. When the user clicks on any of the hikes they have already been on, the user may see the comments of others and edit / delete their own trip. The bar on the left is a pull out navigator which can be both open and closed. The next thing on the nav bar is the Record Hike tab. This tab will transfer the user to be able to record and edit their hike, and it will look very similar to the detailed version of My Hikes (The second picture of the big frames). The user will be able to load up a route of their choice, record difficulty, and upload comments and pictures of specific pin points during the route. They also will be able to record the amount of time it took them to do the hike themselves.
The Find Routes page will consist of a search bar which by default will sort out routes uploaded by other people by keyword and location. Advanced searches will help a user search out a route via difficulty, location, name, distance, reviews, etc. Once the user clicks on a route created by someone else, it the user will be viewing a review of the page just like the one they created in "Record Hike", except with no edit / delete button, and with the ability to comment instead.
